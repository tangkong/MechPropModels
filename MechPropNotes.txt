Mech Prop Models Thoughts, Notes, To-Do
===============================================================================
Questions:
    What is the best scoring system?  For regressors, r2/rms?
    Opinions on how to deal with duplicates
    Which datasets include which others?  
        Only use Suchi's dataset.
        
    Jae had to do a lot of cleaning to be satisfied.  
    Vagard's law performance to compare to our score
    How clustered is data?
    How biased? 
    Try clustering .... based on?
    1% threshold for duplicates?
    
    Figure out error'd lines
    
    Feature descriptions: https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer/tree/master/matminer/utils/data_files/magpie_elementdata
        look for volume?
        density as a feature?  Add this
        
    Correlations between different properties (hardness vs modulus etc)
    
Take aways:
    Wrap up questions
        ? Does it predict new systems well?
        ? Does it outperform vegards's law?
            1: look at linear combination of elements
            2: compare to feature set without density features, how much does the model improve\
        ? Does it interpolate between different chemistries 
            CV by clustering
        ? Look at statistics, deviation, thresholds between values...
